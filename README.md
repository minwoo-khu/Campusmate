# CampusMate

University student app:
- Todo
- Calendar (Todo due + ICS feeds)
- Timetable (image first)
- Courses (UI first, summary/quiz later)

## Roadmap
- v0.1: App shell + settings (choose start tab)
- v0.2: Todo CRUD
- v0.3: Calendar + ICS feed sync
- v0.4: Timetable image upload/view
- v0.5: Course materials UI
- v0.6+: Summary/Quiz backend integration

## Local-first product direction
- Primary goal: free Play Store release with minimal operating cost.
- Keep core features fully offline-first; treat cloud features as optional future add-ons.
- Prefer UX improvements that increase daily retention before backend-dependent features.

For an implementation-ready feature backlog, see `docs_feature_proposals.md`.
