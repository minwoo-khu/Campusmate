# CampusMate Roadmap (Post v1.0.13+14)

This roadmap keeps the same product constraints:
- local-first by default
- no mandatory backend
- low release/operation cost

## Completed Baseline (already shipped)

- Todo quick input, reminder/repeat/priority, grouped list UX
- Calendar month view + ICS feed integration
- Timetable image upload and zoom/pan review
- Course dashboard + PDF material management
- PDF overall note + page memo/tags + memo search/edit/delete
- Backup export/restore with optional PIN encryption
- Korean/English language switch and theme preset system

## Next Priority (before/around next public updates)

1. PDF memo position UX improvement
   - Move from top-anchored behavior toward viewport/tapped-position based memo anchoring.
   - Make lower-page memo authoring/checking faster on long pages.

2. ICS onboarding guidance
   - Add first-run guidance for school ICS connection (where to get URL, HTTPS-only rule).
   - Add reopenable help entry in Settings.

3. Copy/visual consistency pass
   - Final Korean/English wording polish for store-facing release quality.
   - Standardize spacing, chip/button emphasis, and empty-state wording.

## Deferred

1. Home widget UX refresh (currently disabled)
   - Rework layout/readability and click actions.
   - Re-enable after quality pass on update timing and localization consistency.

2. Calendar range customization
   - Revisit custom range options after core calendar readability improvements.

3. Advanced theme customization
   - Expand from presets toward richer user-defined palette controls with guardrails.
