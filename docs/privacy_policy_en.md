# Privacy Policy (Draft)

Last updated: 2026-02-13

CampusMate ("the App") minimizes personal data collection and is designed as a local-first productivity app.

## 1. Data you provide
- Todo items, courses, PDF notes, timetable images, and app settings entered by you.

## 2. Where data is stored
- By default, data is stored on your device (local storage).
- The app may request notification permission for local reminders.

## 3. Network usage
- The app can fetch calendar data only when you provide an ICS URL.
- If no ICS URL is provided, that request is not made.
- User-created content is not uploaded to a developer-operated backend.

## 4. Backup and restore
- You can export and restore backup files in Settings.
- You are responsible for storing, sharing, and deleting backup files safely.

## 5. Third-party services
- The app uses Flutter and platform APIs.
- The app includes Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob) and may show ads.
- Ad requests may involve advertising identifiers and device/app diagnostics provided by ad network SDKs.
- Optional crash reporting via Sentry can be enabled only when the app is built with `ENABLE_SENTRY=true` and a valid `SENTRY_DSN`.
- If Sentry is enabled, technical diagnostics (for example: crash stack trace, device/OS/app version) may be sent to Sentry to monitor app stability.
- If Sentry is not enabled, no crash-reporting data is sent to Sentry.

## 6. Permissions
- Notifications: Todo reminder alerts
- User-selected file access: timetable images, PDFs, backup files

## 7. Children
- The app is not specifically targeted at children and does not knowingly collect children's personal data.

## 8. Contact
- Support email: minwooj02@gmail.com
