# CampusMate Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 13, 2026
Last updated: February 13, 2026

CampusMate ("the App") values your privacy and strives to comply with applicable privacy laws. This Privacy Policy explains what information is processed and for what purposes.

## 1. Data Controller / Contact
- Service name: CampusMate
- Contact: minwooj02@gmail.com

## 2. Information We Process
The App does not require account registration. It primarily works with data you create and store on your device.

1) Information you directly enter/store (stored locally on your device)
- Todo items, course names, PDF-related notes, timetable images, and app settings (theme/language/start tab, etc.)
- ICS URL you provide for school calendar sync

2) Technical information generated while using app features
- Local notification scheduling/configuration data
- Backup files generated by export/restore features

3) Information that may be processed by third-party SDKs
- Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob): advertising identifiers, device/app diagnostics, and related ad delivery/measurement data
- Sentry (optional): crash logs, stack traces, device/OS/app version and related technical diagnostics

## 3. Purposes of Processing
- Provide Todo/Calendar/Timetable/Course material features
- Fetch and display school calendar events via ICS
- Provide local reminders and notifications
- Provide backup/restore functionality
- Support advertising and improve app stability/quality

## 4. How Data Is Processed and Stored
- Core user content is stored locally on your device by default.
- Network requests for ICS are made only when you provide an ICS URL.
- The App does not upload your content to a developer-operated backend server.

## 5. Retention Period
- Locally stored data: until you delete it or uninstall the App
- Backup files: managed by you in your selected storage location
- Third-party SDK data: subject to each provider's retention policy

## 6. Third-Party Services
The App does not sell user content or run a backend for account-based user data. However, the following SDK providers may process certain data under their own policies.

1) Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)
- Purpose: ad delivery, ad performance measurement, fraud prevention
- Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Additional info: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543

2) Sentry (optional)
- Purpose: crash diagnostics and app stability monitoring
- Enabled only when built with `ENABLE_SENTRY=true` and a valid `SENTRY_DSN`
- Policy: https://sentry.io/privacy/

## 7. International Data Transfers
If AdMob or Sentry is enabled, data may be transferred to and processed in countries where those providers operate infrastructure. See each provider's privacy policy for details.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices
You can exercise privacy-related rights as follows:
- Delete in-app data directly in the App or uninstall the App
- Delete backup files from your storage location
- Reset/restrict advertising identifiers in your device OS settings
- Contact us: minwooj02@gmail.com

Because the App has no account-based backend user database, remote per-user access/deletion by the developer is generally not available for locally stored content.

## 9. Security Measures
The App applies safeguards including:
- Optional PIN-based encryption for backup files
- Input/path validation and file size limits for stability and safety
- Restriction of non-HTTPS ICS URLs

## 10. Children's Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 11. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy due to legal, technical, or product changes. Material changes will be reflected through app/store updates.
