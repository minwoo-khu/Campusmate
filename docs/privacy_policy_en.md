# CampusMate Privacy Policy

Effective date: February 24, 2026  
Last updated: February 24, 2026

CampusMate ("the App") respects your privacy and aims to comply with applicable laws.  
This policy explains what information is processed and why.

## 1. Data Controller / Contact

- Service: CampusMate
- Contact: minwooj02@gmail.com

## 2. Information We Process

The App works without mandatory account registration and is designed as local-first.

1) Information you directly create/store (local on your device)
- Todos, course names, PDF notes, timetable images, and app settings
- ICS URL you provide for school calendar sync

2) Technical data generated by features
- Local notification scheduling/configuration data
- Backup files created by export/restore

3) Data that may be processed by third-party SDKs
- Google Mobile Ads SDK (AdMob): ad identifiers, device/app diagnostics, and ad delivery/measurement related data

## 3. Purposes of Processing

- Provide Todo/Calendar/Timetable/Course material features
- Fetch and display school events via ICS
- Provide local reminders/notifications
- Provide backup/restore functionality
- Deliver ads and improve app quality/stability

## 4. Storage and Processing Model

- Core user content is stored locally on your device by default.
- Network requests are made for ICS only when you provide an ICS URL.
- The App does not upload your content to a developer-operated account backend.

## 5. Retention

- Local data: until you delete it or uninstall the App
- Backup files: managed by you at your chosen storage location
- Third-party SDK data: subject to each provider's retention policy

## 6. Third-Party Services

The App does not sell user content and does not run an account-based user content backend.  
However, third-party SDK providers may process limited data under their own policies.

1) Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)
- Purpose: ad delivery, ad performance measurement, fraud prevention
- Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Additional info: https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543

## 7. International Transfers

When AdMob is used, data may be transferred to and processed in countries where the provider operates infrastructure.  
See the provider policy for details.

## 8. Your Rights and Choices

You may exercise privacy-related rights by:

- deleting in-app data directly or uninstalling the App
- deleting backup files from your storage
- resetting/restricting ad identifiers in device settings
- contacting us: minwooj02@gmail.com

Because there is no account-based backend user database, remote per-user data access/deletion by the developer is generally unavailable for local data.

## 9. Security Measures

- optional PIN-based encryption for backup files
- path/input validation and file size limits
- HTTPS-only restriction for ICS URLs

## 10. Children's Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 11. Policy Changes

This policy may be updated due to legal, technical, or product changes.  
Material changes may be announced via app/store updates.
